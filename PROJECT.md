## DragonSwap LP Vault POC — Why Automated LP Is Hard (and How to Solve It)

This Proof of Concept is an ERC4626 vault designed to provide concentrated liquidity on DragonSwap (Uniswap v3 fork). It demonstrates the core flow but intentionally leaves out many production-grade concerns. Below is a outline of the risks, tradeoffs, and the scope required to turn this into a resilient, automated strategy.

### What exists today (POC scope)
- **Single-asset vault**: ERC4626 with `asset = token1`, single LP position, manual manager operations.
- **Instant deposits/withdrawals**: Withdrawals may free liquidity and swap internally to return the asset.
- **Strategy process explained**: See `packages/hardhat/test/DragonSwapLpProviderVault.sei.fork.ts` for a lifecycle test (deposit, swap, create/increase/decrease, withdraw). You can run it on the Sei for against DragonSwap production smart contracts.

### Key challenges to productionize automated LP

- **Fair distribution of profits**:
  - New depositors must not dilute earlier LPs; fees and PnL need to be reflected in share price fairly at all times.
  - Uncollected DEX fees sitting inside the LP position can cause mispricing unless counted in NAV at mint/burn.

- **Resilient balance calculation NAV (Net Asset Value)**:
  - NAV must be resistant to manipulation and short-term volatility. Using spot-only inputs invites MEV/oracle games at mint/burn boundaries.
  - Production systems use time-weighted pricing and redundant sources to value positions and idle balances consistently.

- **Role management and access control**:
  - Operational roles should have guardrails: slippage budgets, price bounds, pool whitelists, and emergency controls.
  - Governance separation (Owner, Manager/Alpha, Guardian) and multi-sig control reduce key-person and operational risk.

- **Spot price manipulation; TWAP needed**:
  - Share pricing, rebalances, and internal swaps should validate against TWAPs to mitigate short-lived spikes.
  - Without TWAP/limits, mint/burn events and large swaps can be profitably manipulated at user expense.

- **Cost sustainability (management fee)**:
  - Automated LP requires frequent transactions (collect, rebalance, compound). Without management/performance fees, operations are economically unsustainable.
  - A transparent fee model aligns incentives and funds ongoing automation and infra.

- **Withdraw fee to stabilize flows**:
  - Small, transparent exit fees can reduce churn and cover the marginal cost of liquidity unwinds during volatile periods.
  - Optional fee exemptions (e.g., scheduled exits) can encourage healthier liquidity behavior.

- **Transparent performance reports**:
  - Stakeholders expect live and historical metrics: TVL, share price/NAV, realized/unrealized PnL, fees earned/compounded, range utilization, and risk flags.
  - On-chain events plus off-chain dashboards enable trust and informed decision-making.

- **Optimal allocation and range management**:
  - A single static range is suboptimal. Professional LP requires dynamic widths, range migration, inventory balancing, and compounding of fees.
  - Policies should adapt to volatility regimes and target utilization to minimize idle cash drag and price risk.

- **Preventing frauds and operational abuse**:
  - Guardrails on sensitive actions (slippage, deadlines, pool/asset whitelists, max notional per action) limit damage from mistakes or abuse.
  - Circuit breakers, pausing, and audit trails allow fast mitigation during anomalies.

- **Withdrawals: UX and risk tradeoffs**:
  - **Instant withdrawals**: Great UX but can force unfavorable unwinds and swaps during stress; must be bounded by slippage, size, and safety checks.
  - **Scheduled withdrawals**: Batching/redemption windows reduce costs and market impact; improve execution quality and predictability.

- **Composable, vetted building blocks (plugins/fuses)**:
  - Strategy automation benefits from pre-tested components for mint/modify/collect/swap. Using vetted, audited “fuses” reduces attack surface and accelerates time-to-market.

### Why IPOR Fusion

Automated LP that is fair, secure, and sustainable is a multidisciplinary challenge—valuation, MEV defense, operations, and governance all matter. These challenges can be addressed rapidly and safely by adopting the IPOR Fusion framework and its Alpha-driven operating model, giving DragonSwap a faster, safer route to a production-grade, automated LP vault.

### The Alpha role in automation

In Fusion, an **Alpha** is the designated operator (can be an EOA, service, or smart contract) that prepares and executes transactions on behalf of the vault within defined constraints. This clean separation enables:

- **Professional operations**: The Alpha manages range re-centering, fee collection/compounding, inventory balancing, and exits—without compromising vault custody.
- **Security and transparency**: Alphas act within policy constraints and can be monitored, rate-limited, or swapped without disrupting user deposits.
- **Scalable automation**: Multiple Alphas can coordinate, with specialization (e.g., credit markets, leveraged looping, UniV3-like LP), to improve performance and reliability.

Applied to DragonSwap LP, the Alpha would:  
- Keep the position within target ranges, adapt widths to volatility, and compound fees.  
- Enforce slippage/TWAP checks, manage scheduled withdrawal windows, and minimize market impact.  
- Produce transparent performance metrics for depositors (LPs).

### Proposed path for a production-ready DragonSwap LP

- **Leverage Fusion’s vetted fuses** for Uniswap-v3-like DEXs to handle mint/modify/collect/swap with guardrails.
- **Define vault policies**: TWAP windows, slippage budgets, pool/token whitelists, allocation targets, and emergency controls.
- **Introduce sustainable fees**: Modest management/performance fees and optional withdrawal fees; publish clear, user-friendly disclosures.
- **Upgrade withdrawals**: Offer both instant (bounded) and scheduled (batched) exits to balance UX and execution quality.
- **Add reporting**: On-chain events + a lightweight dashboard (TVL, NAV/share, PnL, fees, risk flags).
- **Operate via an Alpha**: Run automation within policy to deliver consistent performance and auditability.
